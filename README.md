### Main files

* param_estimation_Approach1and2.m. Runs the model to estimate the parameters using Approach 1 and Appraoch 2 (described in the manuscript). The simulation results compare the change in concentration of Angiotensin II (ANG II) with increasing glucose for Approach 1 and different scenarios of Approach 2. The results are compared using root mean squared error (RMSE) using a data set from literature.
* param_estimation_Approach3.m. Runs the model to estimate the parameters using Approach 3 (described in the manuscript). The simulation results compare the change in concentration of ANG II with increasing glucose for Approach 3.
* Sensanalysis.m. Runs local sensitivity analysis on ANG II with respect to all the parameters. The resulting plots show sensitivity of all the parameters at normal and high glucose states.
* globalsensitivity.m. Runs global sensitivity analysis on ANG II with respect to all the parameters. The resulting plots show two sensitivity indices S_i (Ô¨Årst-order index) and S_{Ti} (total-order index which accounts for higher-order and non-linear interactions between the parameters) for ANG II with respect to each input parameter.

### Supplementary files
 
* glucoseRASssA12.m. Runs through param_estimation_Approach1and2.m and returns ANG II concentration by solving the set of equations. It is used to pass different set of coefficients for each case of Approach 1 and 2.
* glucoseRASssA3.m. Runs through param_estimation_Approach1and2.m and returns ANG II concentration by solving the set of equations. It is used to pass different set of coefficients for Approach 3.
* glucoseRASssSens.m. Runs through param_estimation_Approach1and2.m and returns ANG II concentration by solving the set of equations. It is used to pass the parameter values at NG and HG with a devaition to do the sensitivity analysis.
